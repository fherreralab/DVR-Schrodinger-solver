PROJECT STEPS:

Motivate the problem: What is the (radial) Hamiltonian of a molecular vibration? radial kinetic energy and potential energy curve (1D problem). Plot the potential energy curve for LiCs as an example (LiCs input, interpolate later, etc.)
How is this solved in the DVR approach: discretization of nuclear grid, representation of kinetic and potential energy terms in discrete funcional basis. Show how the continuous variable problem (nuclear coordinate) is transformed into a matrix diagonalization in discrete space. 
How are the results of the diagonalization related to the spectrum of the continuous Hamiltonian? Compare DVR LiCs energies with experimental Dunham expansion (write the expansion). 
(fort2py?) Motivate users to try other potentials: simple harmonic oscillator, Morse potential, superconducting flux qubit potential, etc.
